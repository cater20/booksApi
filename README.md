## Description
Let's create a simple app to store information about books.
In this app, we will store information about the ISBN of the book, title, author, published date, and 
publisher and number of pages.

Naturally, the basic functionality of the API will be CRUD functionality. We'll want to be able to send requests to it to create, read, update and delete 
Book entities. 
Of course, an API may do much more than this - provide users with an enpoint to get statistical data.
